# **WONKI**



## 1. Project Description
> **WONKI** is a freemium educational code editor perfectly designed for people who want to start programming. It offers courses in many different programming languages.

> **Versions**
> - *Free* :
    Includes the default funtionalities.
    All users start with the Free version.
> - *Premium* :
