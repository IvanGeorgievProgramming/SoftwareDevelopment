# **WONKI**



## 1. Project Description
**WONKI** is a freemium educational code editor perfectly designed for people who want to start programming. It offers courses in many different programming languages. In addition, **WONKI** provides the ability to write code using natural speech, which can come in handy on various occasions. Its design helps with time management, relieves stress, and stimulates creativity while providing energy and optimism.

**Versions**
- *Free* :
    Includes the default funtionalities.
    All users start with the Free version.
- *Premium* :
    Includes all funtionalities.
    To gain temporary access to the Premium version, the user must pay a certain amount per month/year.
- *Freemium* :
    Includes all funtionalities.

    There are two ways to generate theese points: Active and Passive.
    In the active way the user gains WONKI points when gaining achievements, doing missions and uploading commands.
    In the passive way the user gains WONKI points while coding.

## 5. The Current State of the Project
Still choosing which technologies to use.
- **Web Application** : ***`Python (Django)`***
- **Desktop Application** : `Qt for C++`, **`Qt for Python`**, **`Java (JavaFx)`** or `Java (Swing)`
- **Speech to text** : ***`Python`***



## 6. Budget
The project does not need a budget right now.



## 7. Deadline
The project is separated in two parts:
- *Web Application + Desktop Application* - 31.07.2023
- *Speech to Code* - 15.09.2023



## 8. Final Word
It should be stressed that this project is intended to be a thesis for 12th grade and that is the reason why the deadlines are increased.
